✔️ How to set up and interact with the OpenAI API.
✔️ How to translate Natural Language to SQL queries using OpenAI's API.
✔️ Tips and tricks to get the most accurate SQL translations.

🔑 Key Takeaways:

After following along with this video, you'll not only understand how to use the OpenAI API for this specific task, but you'll also have a grasp of how it can be leveraged for a wide array of other applications. With the ability to convert English statements into SQL queries, you can make database interaction more intuitive and less error-prone, opening up a world of possibilities.


## Getting started

To run the example code, you need to create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

1. Install requirements using
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Create a .env file and paste your API key there
```.env
OPENAI_API_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
```
3. Run the code and Enjoy
```bash
$ python server.py
```
